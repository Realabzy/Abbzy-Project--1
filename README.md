# Improvements

websites can be made more responsive to all screen 

overall touch up on html and css would be ideal in order to better improve website styling and customization .

.Overprocrastination and initial worry cause me to be not proactive in the start and those times could have been spent making the website better in terms of visual and overall appeal.
